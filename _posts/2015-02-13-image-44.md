I wasn't going to use this image, as I'm not really happy with how it came out. But I've decided to put it up, because I think it's important to me. 

The nebulous genre of "street photography" is one that has been interesting me more and more in my photography journey - it can be amusing, informative, surreal, shocking, or some combination of these qualities, amongst others I have no doubt omitted. It's incredible how many interesting little stories are played out around us and we usually have our heads down, missing it all. There are two particular factors that, to me, are notable about this picture; or rather, how it came to be made. 

The first is: it's pretty scary trying to take pictures of the things that are going on around you, when that involves photographing strangers. What do they think? Do they care? Will they get angry? Feel threatened? I am particularly anxious and self conscious about this generally, even outside of photography, and aside from one other photograph in this set, I haven't actually attempted to take any candid photos of strangers. (The one I have included was met with responses of "Oh my god, did you ask her", "That's just weird", "Why would you do that", etc., which strikes me as an unusual, and in most cases hypocritical, reaction.) Here I have tried again, and while admittedly it is a fairly distant shot, it required me to get over my hesitance and self doubt, but without using some shoulder-mounted paparazzi lens from half a mile away. 

Secondly, a photograph, at least one taken in the street, tends to be pretty boring without some sort of story, or emotion attached to it. Without a little detail, a glimpse of a shared moment, a meaningful interaction, or a bit of humour, it's just some people on a road. Amazing. So, I didn't just snap this. I saw the hearts, thought of the set up (which is completely cliched, I know), and attempted to execute it. It wasn't just an accident. 

So, although it's blurred, and it's kind of cheesy, and not really original, and the lady isn't quite as short as would have been ideal, none of those things are relevant to **this**: my _personal_ project. What is relevant is that I started overcoming some fears, and put some creative thought into an image that I might otherwise have just walked on past. And starting to really _see_ things can only be a good thing.

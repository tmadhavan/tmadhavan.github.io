title:   Sunset Over Rest Bay (1)
excerptimage: ../images/25.jpg
---

Managed to get to Rest Bay (near Porthcawl) and get a shot of the sunset, such as it was. It was a bit cloudy, and cold, but the light was decent for a short period. I managed to get this shot, and no. 26 just as the sun finally disappeared. I definitely need to spend more time visiting Wales' coast.

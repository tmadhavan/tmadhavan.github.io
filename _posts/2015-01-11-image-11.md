Today Benj and I had the misfortune to visit Grangemoor Park, hoping for some interesting shots. After struggling to make weeds look good, we found this bridge. I couldn't leave without a photo, so I tried to make something interesting out of the diagonals and the light seeping through from the rail track above.

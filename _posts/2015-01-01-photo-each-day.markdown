title: A Photo Each Day
published: true
---

For 2015, I will attempt to create a photo for each day of the year. Ideally this will involved getting out every day to create new images, but if this isn't possible, I'd like to at least take enough pictures to share one half-decent one per day. The aim isn't to create amazing art, but to motivate myself to get out and shoot. 

Here goes.

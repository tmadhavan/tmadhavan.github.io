Bought myself a new flash ([a Yongnuo YN-560 III](http://flashhavoc.com/yongnuo-yn-560-iii-review/)), and I'm trying to learn how to use it. As I'm a ~~victim~~ participant in a [friend's](https://www.facebook.com/lucyjanepurringtonart) uni project, I thought I'd try it on her. 

No idea what I'm doing with it yet (it's all manual), but there is a *lot* of potential for fun here.

It was getting a bit dark, and I didn't my photo for the day, so I had a little wander up a back alley in Roath. Amongst the hedge cuttings, discarded builders' plasterboards, and suspicious cats, I found a nice bit of colour and texture on a small wooden door. Doors seem to be becoming a bit of a theme, but it's surprising what's interesting if you look (or can bullshit it).

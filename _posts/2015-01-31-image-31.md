It was getting a bit dark, and I didn't have my photo for the day, so I had a little wander up a back alley in Roath (never know what you might find...). Amongst the hedge cuttings, discarded builders' plasterboards, and suspicious cats, I found a nice bit of colour and texture on a small wooden door. You can find something interesting if you look hard enough.

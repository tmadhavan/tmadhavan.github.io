Totally blew out the highlights in the sky, but one picture is better than no picture. This is also the first time I've had to cheat. I went out today, in the rain, and the dark, and tried to get some photos. They were awful, so I used this picture from Saturday. But I tried, and this project is about getting out and trying to get photos, every day.

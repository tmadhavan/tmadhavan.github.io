title:   Sherman Theatre at Dusk

Back to pictures of buildings: this is the Sherman Theatre (Cardiff) just as it was getting dark. I'd taken a picture earlier and loved the new(ish) purple lighting they've got, along with the scales on the wall. I decided to revisit it on my way back home, and it looks much more impressive in the dark; it's particularly interesting with the light reflected off the wet tarmac. 

The original shot was a little wider (although I only had my 25mm lens with me), which was a better aspect ratio I think, but an annoying lamppost ruined it. It looks pretty good with a "squarer" crop, too. Maybe it's a bit too saturated though. Agree or disagree? Leave a comment!

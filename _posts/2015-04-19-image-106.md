Really pleased with this shot. It's probably the first time I've seen a nice bit of light, known what I wanted to image to look like, and then been quick enough to get my camera in hand before it was too late. I waited around for another few minutes to see if I could get another picture, but nobody showed, so I'm doubly proud of grabbing this one.

A long exposure just after sunset, looking down at Newport Rd near the centre of Cardiff. With a bit of luck, I caught a train shooting over the bridge. 

Cheers to [Benj](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ben_pope2000/) for joining me in the dark and cold. He got some good shots, too (better, in fact - check them out, especially the one [with the bus](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ben_pope2000/16156672077/)!).
